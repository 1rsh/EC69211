### How to Run:
To try run `exp3.ipynb` directly.

The code contains the `Experiment3` class which can be used for making FFT and IFFT of images. It also contains functions to visualize phase and magnitude spectrum and to do the given operations on the image.

After the given operations, the image seems to be rotated by 180 degrees, this is because in the spatial domain the operations correspond to a 180 deg rotation which manifests itself in the image (signal) domain.
